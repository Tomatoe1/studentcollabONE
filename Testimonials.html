            There are three elements that make up a definition list:

                1) The <dl></dl> tags designate the type of list and serve 
                    as a grouping container for all items in the list.
                2) The <dt></dt> tags designate the term to be defined
                3) The <dd></dd> tags provide the definition/description 
                    for the term it is associated with.

            Consider the following code snippet added to our previous document for an example of a definition list:

        <h2>Definition Lists</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>What I'm Good At:</dt>
            <dd>I am very good at handling customer interactions via phone or in person. I know what I expect
                and I provide that to all mhy customers at all possible cost.
            </dd>
            <dt>What I Want:</dt>
            <dd>What I want is a job where I have hands on, so I may have direct interaction with equipment
                that needs technical service or expertise. I can either handle customer related issues or handle 
                the equipment, but if both are required then neither will get the best service.
